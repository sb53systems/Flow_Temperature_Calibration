# Ideal Flow Vs Hotend Temperature Calibration
A program that allows you to control a 3D printer in real time, and calculate the temperature of the extruded filament, using a contactless temperature sensor connected to the printer's motherboard (EX: MLX90614ESF-DCI).  
Playing with the Flow/Speed and the hotend temperature, it records the values ​​where the filament is extruded with the requested ideal temperature.
