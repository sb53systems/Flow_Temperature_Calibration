# Ideal Flow/Temperature Calibration
It is a program that allows you to control a 3D printer in real time, and to calculate the temperature of the extruded filament using a temperature detector connected to the motherboard of the printer (EX: MLX90614ESF-DCI).  
  
This project is under development, and will take days. Your contribution and support are welcome. Thank you.
