# Ideal Flow Vs Hotend Temperature Calibration
A program that controls a 3D printer in real time using USB or Local Network, and calculate the disired temperature of the extruded filament for a range of Flow rates and create a Temp Curve File, from 0mm³/s to the Max Flow or Max Temp.  
Using a contactless temperature sensor connected to the printer's motherboard (EX: MLX90614ESF-DCI), and playing with the hotend temperature and Flow rate, it records the values ​​where the filament is extruded with the requested temperature.  
  
This project is under development, and will take days. Your contribution and support are welcome.
